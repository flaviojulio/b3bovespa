# B3Bovespa

This repository scraps all the companies listed on the Bovespa B3 using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io).

## Drivers

To allow web scrapping, it is necessary to download the driver accordingly to your preferred
browser. Currently, the only supported browsers are *Chrome* and *Firefox*.

* [Chrome's chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
* [Firefox's geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

It is necessary that the *driver's* version is compatible with the current version
of the installed browser.
